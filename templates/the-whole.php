                The Whole is a web interface that brings together your news feed from various sources and presents it on only one platform. The Whole is currently a project in design phase.

            <h2>The Concept</h2>
            <h3>Connect and follow the world</h3>
            <p>
                The Whole concept is to propose a platform that unifies all your services on a single interface. Social networks, RSS, music or any other service would be available on the same application and propose the same functionality. 
            </p><!--
            !--><p>
                The Whole is currently a prototype, which was achieved with only 6 services (Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Sound Cloud, Last Fm Rss Feed). However, itwas thought that any other service could be integrated.

                    It was necessary to make a set of elements with a common visual theme that can work separately and together to create a rich and interactive atmosphere.<br/><br/> 
                    Each element has been thought before production. I had then the pleasure to design and make small details on each of those elements.
